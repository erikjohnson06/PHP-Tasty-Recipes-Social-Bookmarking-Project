Tasty Recipes is a social recipe bookmarking site based on the popular bookmark sharing site del.ico.us (delicious.com). The site was built as a project for the O'Reilly PHP/SQL 3 course to demonstrate the Web 2.0 concept of scalability, user-generated content, folksonomy, etc. Each php file contains information about its primary functionality at the top, along with comments throughout to clarify the purposes of the various functions, etc.
